# Image-to-Text Generation Model

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application that allows users to upload images and receive text descriptions generated by a machine learning model. The project is built using Python for the backend, with a deep learning model for image captioning. The frontend is developed using a modern web framework, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the model.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images through a user-friendly interface.
- **Text Generation**: A pre-trained deep learning model generates descriptive text from the uploaded images.
- **REST API**: The backend provides a RESTful API for image processing and text generation.
- **Database Integration**: Uploaded images and generated captions are stored in a database for future reference.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The application is built to scale, with separate components for the frontend, backend, and model inference.
